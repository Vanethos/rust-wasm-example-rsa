# Rust and WASM in Flutter

This project showcases how we can use WASM and Flutter for improving the performance of our apps.

## The Example

For the example, we are creating a RSA Key Pair and encrypting a simple string provided by the user.

With the input "A message" we get the following results:
* Flutter - 31 693 ms
* WASM    -  3 849 ms
